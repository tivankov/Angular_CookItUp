## Čevapi Recipe

### Ingredients

**For the Čevapi:**
- 500g ground beef
- 250g ground lamb
- 1 small onion, finely grated
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to your spice preference)
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda (helps with texture)
- 1/4 cup sparkling water or club soda (optional, for extra tenderness)

**For Serving:**
- Fresh flatbreads or pita
- Chopped onions
- Ajvar (red pepper and eggplant relish)
- Kajmak (a creamy dairy spread)
- Yogurt or sour cream
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Vegetable oil for grilling

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Meat Mixture:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef and lamb.
   - Add the finely grated onion, minced garlic, paprika, ground black pepper, salt, and red pepper flakes to the meat mixture.
   - If you want extra tenderness, add the baking soda and sparkling water or club soda at this stage. Mix everything thoroughly until well combined. The sparkling water will create a lighter texture.

2. **Shape the Čevapi:**
   - Wet your hands with cold water to prevent the meat from sticking.
   - Take small portions of the meat mixture and shape them into small, finger-sized sausages, about 3-4 inches long and 1/2 inch in diameter. You can use a little oil on your hands if needed to prevent sticking.

3. **Preheat the Grill:**
   - Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. You can also use a grill pan or a regular frying pan if a grill is not available.

4. **Grill the Čevapi:**
   - Brush the Čevapi lightly with vegetable oil to prevent sticking.
   - Place the Čevapi on the grill and cook for about 5-7 minutes per side or until they are nicely browned and cooked through. They should be slightly crispy on the outside but still tender on the inside.

5. **Serve the Čevapi:**
   - Warm the flatbreads or pita on the grill for a minute or so.
   - Serve the Čevapi on the warm bread with chopped onions, ajvar, kajmak, and a dollop of yogurt or sour cream.
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.

6. **Enjoy:**
   - Čevapi are typically eaten with your hands, so don't be afraid to get a little messy! Enjoy your delicious Balkan meal.
