### Ingredients:
- 8 oz (225g) spaghetti
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese
- 4 oz (115g) pancetta, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- Fresh parsley, for garnish

### Instructions:
1. Cook spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.

2. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Season with a pinch of black pepper. Set aside.

3. In a skillet over medium heat, cook the diced pancetta until it becomes crispy, about 4-5 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.

4. Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta and garlic. Toss to combine and heat through for a couple of minutes.

5. Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot spaghetti. Toss vigorously to create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a tablespoon of pasta cooking water to thin it out.

6. Season with salt and more black pepper if needed. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve immediately.
