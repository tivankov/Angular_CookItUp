### Ingredients:
- 1 lb (450g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced
- 2 cups broccoli florets
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 yellow bell pepper, sliced
- 1/2 cup sliced carrots
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil (optional)
- Cooked rice, for serving

### Instructions:
1. In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, and minced garlic. Set aside.

2. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Add the sliced chicken and stir-fry until it's cooked through and no longer pink, about 5-6 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.

3. In the same skillet, add a bit more oil if needed, and stir-fry the broccoli, bell peppers, and carrots until they are tender-crisp, about 4-5 minutes.

4. Return the cooked chicken to the skillet and pour the sauce over the chicken and vegetables. Stir-fry for an additional 2-3 minutes until everything is well coated and heated through.

5. If desired, drizzle with sesame oil for added flavor.

6. Serve the chicken stir-fry hot over cooked rice.
