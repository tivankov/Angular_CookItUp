### Ingredients:
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 cup chopped nuts (optional)

### Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy.

3. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then stir in the vanilla extract.

4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the butter and sugar mixture, mixing until well combined.

5. Fold in the semisweet chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using).

6. Drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

7. Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes or until the edges are golden brown but the centers are still soft.

8. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.

9. Enjoy your homemade Non-Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies with a glass of milk!
