### Ingredients:
- 4 ounces (113g) high-quality semisweet chocolate, chopped
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 2 large eggs
- 2 large egg yolks
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- Pinch of salt
- Non-stick cooking spray or extra butter for greasing
- Powdered sugar, for dusting (optional)
- Fresh berries or vanilla ice cream, for serving (optional)

### Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Grease four ramekins or oven-safe dessert dishes with non-stick cooking spray or butter.

2. Place the chopped semisweet chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 20-second intervals, stirring each time until the chocolate and butter are melted and smooth. Alternatively, you can melt them together in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water (double boiler).

3. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, granulated sugar, and vanilla extract until well combined.

4. Slowly pour the melted chocolate and butter mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly until smooth.

5. Sift in the all-purpose flour and a pinch of salt into the chocolate mixture. Gently fold the flour into the mixture until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.

6. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared ramekins.

7. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 12-14 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center is still slightly jiggly.

8. Carefully remove the lava cakes from the oven and let them cool for 2-3 minutes.

9. To serve, run a knife around the edge of each ramekin to loosen the cakes. Invert each cake onto a dessert plate. The gooey chocolate center should ooze out.

10. Dust the tops with powdered sugar if desired, and serve immediately with fresh berries or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
